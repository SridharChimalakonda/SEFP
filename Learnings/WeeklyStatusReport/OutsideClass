What you learnt outside the class?
Be specific...

Week1:

Nothing.


Week2:

Had a snap-peek into what functional-programming(Scala) is. It basically executes every 
functionality of a program in the form of pure functions.

Week 3:
	Started to learn Scala and Erlan. I have decided to learn Erlan as it helps to communicate 
between multi-distributed systems as suggested by Arihant sir in our tutorial class.
	We are given an programming assignment in which we have to code in Erlan to print hello world and first 100 
natural numbers.
