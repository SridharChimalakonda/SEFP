What you learnt inside the class?

Week1

#1 Started with introduction to Software Engineering and explaining course structure.
#2 Modification/Enhancement in Pokemon GO and building something on top of Augmented reality was discussed.
#3 Some really nice ideas came up in the discussion.
#4 Importance of quality was discussed.
#5 We were asked to illustrate different kind of user sets for Pokemon GO.
#6 A quote on Quality - "Something which can't be seen but carries essence, which can't be explained but can be experienced."

Week2

#1 Discussed 10-11 project ideas with my teammate. Few of them can be turned into a BIG startup !

#2 Movie making vs Software Engineering
#3 An awesome motivational class by Arihant Sir
#4 Insight to various foundational question like why to study RDBMS ? why to use python over C++ ?

Week4

#1 Importance of requirements in Software Engineering ! It's so critical ! I never thought this way.
#2 Every lifecycle model revolves around Waterfall model.
#3 Requirement specification should be unambiguous as much as possible.

Week5

#1 Many different models we studied today.
#2 My personal vote will go for spiral model since the iterations changes the abstraction everytime.
#3 Big debate on agile models. is comprehensive documentation good or we should focus more on final deliverables ?
#4 Agile models(80%) + Unified processes(20%) = An amazing adaptive model
#5 How to believe in someone else's code ? Will it affect the quality.

Week6

#1 Design is something inevitable in SE but still design in alone can't be used in project management there are other things as well to be considered.
#2 Even code is also a design but it comes at the lowest level of granualarity.
#3 Sir discussed my project with whole class and this helped me in analyzing my project even more. I also got to hear many good ideas from others about my topic probably I have to look things in the project differently.
#4 A project design should go in this order: Goals->Constraints->Assumptions->Decisions->Ideas
#5 Design is a representation/formulation of our solution to a given problem.
