Week1

Pokemon Go(Developed by Niantic) App Class Discussion:

	Key Points:
		1)No app is perfect.Every app has some defects,trade-offs.	
 		So, to improve its services it has to evlove.

		2)How can we improve an app, which features are the most attractive in an app.

		3)Can some features of an app (Pokemon Go) like 3-D augmented reality technology be 
		 used in some other way like 3-D version of Google Maps,Augmented interior house designing ?

Week 2

Quality of Software:
		
	Keypoints:
		 1)What do you mean by 'Quality'? How do you compare quality ?
	       	 Ans)Quality is related to being superior or inferior when a product is compared to others.
		 It is done on basis of utility,reliabilty,performance etc and also which meets the user
		 requirements.

		 2) Why "Apple" is able to make quality products ?
		 Ans) The process to make a quality product should be stringent and fair.
		 The rigorous testing and checking while production are the main factors which make a quality product.
	
		 3)Importance of Quality Software:
		 Innovation and invention are the key factors which are driving the world's needs
		 and also its future. In future, every basic thing which uses software should be of
		 good quality,i.e  free of bugs. For example: A pilot flying a airplane fails to 
		 execute the land-gear function during landing due to a failure or bug in the code
		 then it may endanger the life of the passengers in the plane.
		
		 4)What are some characteristics of a quality Product?
			i)Correctness.
			ii)Efficiency.
			iii)Functionality.
			iv)Reliablity.
			v)User-friendly.
			vi)Compatiblity.
			vii)Adaptability.
			viii)Cost.
			ix)Design.
			

Week 3:
 
Introduction to Software engineering:
		
	Keypoints:
		 1)What is Software?How is it different from engineering?
		 Ans) Software is a basic piece of code which are programmed to perform some useful
		 tasks and applications. Engineering is designing products using theortical concepts 
		 and principles to achieve real-time working capabilties. 

		 2)What is Software Engineering?
		 Ans) Software engineering is the branch which designs a product(software) using some
		 theortical concepts or principles which can run on a device to perform useful tasks and 
		 applications.
			Important Question: What is Software?
				Is it a Science? Is it an Art? Is it Manufacturing?
			

			Software engineering requirements:
				i)Identifying User Requirements.
				ii)Optimize System design.
				iii)System analysis to recognise problems and optimization.
				iv)Code Design.
				v)Testing for verification of bug-free apps.
				vi)Beta Testing and prototypes for experiments and user feedback.
				vii)Deployment of product.
				viii)Maintainence.
