Q1) Which systems obey Logical completeness?
a)	Complete systems , but unreliable.
b)	Incomplete systems, but reliable.
c)	Complete systems, and reliable.
d)	Incomplete systems, and unreliable.
Ans : Option (a) and (c) are correct because according to logical completeness, it is better to have a system which is fully functional(error-free) even if it is unreliable. Because incomplete systems  are full of errors.

Q2) What is relationship is true for processes to make a product and the final product itself?
a)	For each process there is an impact on quality of the final product.
b)	For each process there may or may not be an impact on quality of the final product.
c)	Design-making decisions only impact a particular stage only.
d)	For every decision made, there is a corresponding impact on all stages.
Ans) option (a) and (d) are correct.

Q3) What options is more appropriate?
a)	Top-down approach: Building, Rooms, Floors; Bottom-up :  Satellites, Planets, Stars.
b)	Bottom-up: City, State, Roads ;  Top-down: OS, Applications, programs. 
c)	Top-down:   State, City, Roads ; Bottom-up: Satellites, Planets, Stars.
d)	Top-down: OS, Applications, programs. ;Bottom-up:  moon, sun, earth.
Ans) option (c) is correct.

Fill in the blanks :
1)	Each step taken in a process impact the quality of the final product.
2)	The Dijkstra’s work verifies the proof of correctness of a program.
