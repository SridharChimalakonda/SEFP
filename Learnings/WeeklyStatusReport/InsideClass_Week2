What you learnt inside the class?

Week2

I learnt about user-interface design.. A lot of bad practices struck to me and made me realize that they will lead to the downside of the product.


User-interface should be moulded such that they meet the expectations of the customers..

I also learnt the usability of User-interfaces which are:

1. Ease of learning
2. Productivity
3. Minimal error rates
4. High user stisfaction
